# Mountain Car – Tile Coding + SARSA(λ)

Reinforcement learning agent trained from scratch to solve the classic Mountain Car problem using:

- Tile coding for function approximation
- SARSA(λ) for temporal credit assignment
- Custom reward shaping
- No external RL libraries (no Gym, no stable-baselines)
